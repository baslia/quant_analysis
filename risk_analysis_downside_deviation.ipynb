    "# How to power trading portfolio risk analysis with downside deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio risk is the potential for financial loss and uncertainty about its extent. Downside deviation is a common measure of financial risk that measures the volatility of negative returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This measure gives a more accurate picture of the type of risk traders care about:\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of losing money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since volatility to the upside is not usually a concern, downside risk is used by traders to gauge the risks that lead to portfolio drawdown—a key worry."
