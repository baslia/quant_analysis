    "# Calibrating volatility smiles with SABR\n",
    "The SABR model, built in 2002, stands as a key stochastic volatility framework in finance for modeling derivatives. SABR stands for \"stochastic alpha, beta, rho\" which are the key inputs to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "SABR is good at capturing the market-observed anomalies such as skew and smile.\n",
    "\n",
    "It operates on the premise that asset prices follow a geometric Brownian motion while volatility follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, parameterized by alpha (initial volatility level), beta (variance elasticity), rho (price-volatility correlation), and nu (volatility's volatility).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of its standout features is the closed-form approximation for implied volatility—known as the Hagan formula—which allows for fast and accurate computations of implied volatility across strike prices."
